<b><h1>Stress Detection In IT Professionals By Using Image Processing And Machine Learning:</h1>

The main motive of our project is to detect stress in the IT professionals using vivid Machine learning and Image processing techniques. Our system is an upgraded version of the old stress detection systems which excluded the live detection and the personal counseling but this system comprises of live detection and periodic analysis of employees and detecting physical as well as mental stress levels in his/her by providing them with proper remedies for managing stress by providing survey form periodically. Our system mainly focuses on managing stress and making the working environment healthy and spontaneous for the employees and to get the best out of them during working hours.

<h2>KEYWORDS:</h2>
<br>1. Machine Learning
<br>2. Image Processing
<br>3. K-Nearest Neighbors
<br>4. Supervised Learning
<br>5. Convolutional Neural Network
<br>6. Neural Networks

<h2>PROPOSED SYSTEM:</h2>
Our proposed system works on the concept of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).CNN is a neural network technique.A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. It uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. A simple neural network includes an input layer, an output (or target) layer and, in between, a hidden layer. The layers are connected via nodes, and these connections form a “network” – the neural network.

<h2>ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:</h2>
<br>1. Very High accuracy in image recognition problems.
<br>2. Automatically detects the important features without any human supervision.
<br>3. More efficient when compared to KNN.</b>
